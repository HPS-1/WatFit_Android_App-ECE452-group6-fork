## StarTracker
An app that could help to identify objects of interest in the local celestial hemisphere (during night), including but not limited to constellations, meteor showers, and artificial orbiters.

Key Features:
1. Should be able to function with only pre-downloaded/written-in data and approximate location (i.e. no need for network or satellite signal).
2. Should be able to present the objects of interest with easily understandable GUI.
3. Should allow the user to predict objects of interest at a given location in the near future, so that they may plan their trips accordingly.

## UW Flow Enhanced
An app that allows students to search for desired course for their subsequent terms based on an automated marking system, where the formula used to generate marks are highly customizable.

E.g MARK=50\*LIKED(%)+50\*USEFUL(%)-5\*(12-NUMBERofRATINGS)-3\*(5-NUMBERofCOMMENTS)

Key Features:
1. Should be highly customizable! The whole marking formula should be modifiable.
2. Link courses to their syllabuses. Like the ones here: https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/undergraduate-students/academic-planning-and-support/technical-electives-tes
3. Add support for course dependency check and some other options?
