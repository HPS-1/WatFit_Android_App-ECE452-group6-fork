## StarTracker
An app that could help to identify objects of interest in the local celestial hemisphere (during night), including but not limited to constellations, meteor showers, and artificial orbiters.

Key Features:
1. Should be able to function with only pre-downloaded/written-in data and approximate location (i.e. no need for network or satellite signal).
2. Should be able to present the objects of interest with easily understandable GUI.
3. Should allow the user to predict objects of interest at a given location in the near future, so that they may plan their trips accordingly.
