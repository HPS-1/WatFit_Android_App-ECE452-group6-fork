## Personal Expense Tracker
The app requires an user account to sign-in. Once in the app, user can input their income, expenses, mortgages, savings, and budgets. The app monitors user's monthly spendings and compare it with the income and savings. 

The app should use visualizations to demonstrate the user's spending trend and provide useful insights. For example, if user's expense is almost equivalent to their income for several consecutive months, the app should raise alert to notify user, and also provide suggestions on how to save money (or provide URLs to websites that can provide meaningful financial advise)

## Company Review and Rating Platform
This app is designed to provide an open platform where user can submit a review for a company (and the position) that the user is working (or worked) for. Once the review is submitted, it can be viewed by other app users if they search up the company's name or job title. 

User needs to login an account to start a review. In a company review, user needs to complete a series of questions (similar to a survey), where each answer has the corresponding score stored in the backend. For example, a question can be like: how often do you have to work overtime?
| Answer       | Score |
|------------|-----------|
|Very Often|0|
|Somewhat Often|1|
|Not Often|2|
|Never|3|

Based on the user's answer to the list of questions, the app will generate a Recommendation Score for [Company Name]'s [Job Title] role. In the last part of the submission, the user can also write reviews. Once the review is submitted, the app will automatically calculates the Job's Recommendation Score, combine it with the user's text review and create a post with other users can view it by searching the company's name or job title.
