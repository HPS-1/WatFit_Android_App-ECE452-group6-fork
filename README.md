This is our group project for ECE 452, an Andriod app called "WatFit". In accord with the project proposal, this project aims to develop an Android mobile application that provides users with comprehensive assistance in managing nutrition, planning meals, monitoring physical conditions, and sharing fitness results. Additionally, the app will utilize advanced algorithms to generate personalized training plans,
promoting a healthier lifestyle and simplifying wellness planning. Additional information can be found here: https://github.com/HPS-1/WatFit_Android_App-ECE452-group6-fork/blob/main/cs446-d1_WatFit.pdf
